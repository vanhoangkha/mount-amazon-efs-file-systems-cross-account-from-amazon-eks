A comprehensive solution for mounting Amazon EFS file systems across AWS accounts from Amazon EKS clusters, specifically designed for banking and financial services with high availability and performance requirements.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This solution implements a **dual-write pattern** where satellite applications write data to both local EFS storage and a shared CoreBank EFS across AWS accounts, ensuring data synchronization with sub-minute recovery times.
