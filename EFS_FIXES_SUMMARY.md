# EFS Cross-Account Fixes and Improvements Summary

## üéØ Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive fixes and improvements made to ensure the EFS test applications on both CoreBank and Satellite accounts can successfully connect and write to the shared EFS.

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Security Group Configuration
**Problem**: Insufficient network access rules for EFS mount operations
**Solution**: 
- Added VPC CIDR-specific rules for primary network access
- Added comprehensive private network CIDR ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16)
- Properly configured NFS port 2049 access

### 2. EFS Access Point Configuration
**Problem**: Incorrect permissions and ownership settings
**Solution**:
- Fixed POSIX permissions to use octal format (0755)
- Added proper user/group ownership (1001:1001)
- Implemented waiting mechanism for access point availability
- Added proper tagging for identification

### 3. EFS Resource Policy
**Problem**: Overly broad or incorrectly scoped resource policies
**Solution**:
- Specific resource ARN targeting instead of wildcard
- Proper access point ARN condition for satellite account
- Separate statements for CoreBank full access and Satellite restricted access
- Enhanced security with principle of least privilege

### 4. Kubernetes Volume Configuration
**Problem**: Incorrect volume handle format and mount configuration
**Solution**:
- Correct EFS volume handle format: `${EFS_ID}::${ACCESS_POINT_ID}` for cross-account
- Proper storage class configuration with access point parameters
- Enhanced mount options for optimal performance
- Encryption in transit enabled

### 5. IAM Roles and IRSA Configuration
**Problem**: Incorrect trust policies and service account configuration
**Solution**:
- Fixed OIDC provider trust relationships
- Proper IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) configuration
- Specific resource ARNs in IAM policies
- Automated EFS CSI driver service account creation

### 6. Pod Security Context
**Problem**: Missing security context causing permission issues
**Solution**:
- Added runAsUser and runAsGroup (1001:1001)
- Configured fsGroup for proper file system access
- Set fsGroupChangePolicy for efficient permission handling

## üöÄ Deployment Workflow

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure AWS CLI is configured with appropriate profiles
aws configure list-profiles

# Verify required tools
which eksctl kubectl docker
```

### Step-by-Step Deployment

#### 1. Deploy EFS Infrastructure
```bash
./scripts/deploy-efs-infrastructure.sh
```
**What it does**:
- Creates CoreBank EFS with proper security groups
- Sets up cross-account access point for Satellite
- Configures EFS resource policy for secure access
- Creates IAM roles for cross-account access

#### 2. Deploy EKS Clusters (if needed)
```bash
./scripts/deploy-eks-clusters.sh
```
**What it does**:
- Creates EKS clusters in both accounts
- Installs EFS CSI driver addon
- Configures IRSA for EFS access
- Sets up cluster networking

#### 3. Build and Push Container Images
```bash
./scripts/build-and-push-image.sh
```
**What it does**:
- Builds Docker images for test applications
- Pushes to ECR repositories in both accounts
- Creates ECR repositories if needed

#### 4. Deploy Test Applications
```bash
./scripts/deploy-efs-test-app.sh
```
**What it does**:
- Deploys applications to both EKS clusters
- Configures proper EFS volume mounts
- Sets up service accounts with IRSA
- Creates load balancers for external access

#### 5. Validate Deployment
```bash
./scripts/validate-efs-deployment.sh
```
**What it does**:
- Tests application health and readiness
- Validates write/read operations
- Tests cross-account file sharing
- Provides comprehensive status report
